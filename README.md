# SNHU CS-340 - Client/Server Development - README
---


## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
>I design my code to follow best practices, such as developing with object-oriented structures and breaking up problems into modular files which become easier to read and understand as a result. The CRUD module of this dashboard allows for the front-end to interact with MongoDB while also containing the necessary functions for added functionality, such as ease of user interaction with adding, removing, and updating animals within the system.


## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
>This project was the closest I've been to producing a stack. Working with a full stack, I was able to gather a better understanding of how the system should be able to function in the end and develop all layers of the stack with that in mind, to a degree. I lacked control over some of the design specifications for included data, which I likely would have filtered for easier viewing. However, I was able to create functions in the CRUD model that directly addressed the needs of the two front end interface types and interact with the backend with ease, thanks to provided PyMongo libraries.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
>Computer scientists leverage current technological advancements and apply them to real world problems in a way that helps companies improve on their ability to provide services or increase the rate of further advancements in their fields, technological or others.
